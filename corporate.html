  <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p>The <strong>TeamBeast&nbsp;</strong>campaign focuses on building brand awareness and engagement among amateur sports teams by promoting the importance of mascots in strengthening team spirit. The campaign uses <strong>Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook</strong>to reach different segments of our target audience. 
  <div>
    <p><strong>Target audience:</strong> </p>
    <p>We spoke to teamplayers and coaches coaches, involved in amateur teams to learn more about their needs and habits. This helped us shape our content and platform focus.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a href="https://edubuas-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/232646_buas_nl/EjKUUaTY_YxLgle7ko4HG8IBUF_whtkhdtTpenrMA8H3NQ?e=9U1bPT" >link to interviews</a>

<p><strong>Primary:</strong></p>
    <p>18-25 Young, ambitious team captains and players who are passionate about their sport and team identity. --&gt; These players are passionate about their sport and want to build a strong team identity. Many of them take leadership roles and are looking for ways to bring their team together. Our mascots give them a fun way to boost team spirit.</p>
    <p>26 – 40 years experienced coaches, team managers, and leaders who are more involved in the organization and long-term development of their team. --&gt; This group is responsible for the team’s long-term success and organization. They know that team spirit is important but often don’t have extra money to spend on it. Our mascots give them an affordable way to strengthen team unity.</p>
 <p><strong>Secondary:</strong></p>
<p>12–25 years: younger supporters and players who want to identify with their team. Younger players and fans want to feel part of their team. A mascot gives them a fun and recognizable symbol to support and rally behind.</p>

26 – 50+ year: Parents, friends, and local fans who support the club and value the atmosphere around the team. --&gt; These people help create a great atmosphere around the team. They love to show their support, whether by cheering at games or sponsoring the teams. Our mascots give them another way to celebrate their favourite team.

			 <p><div>
			   <p><strong><br>
			     </strong></p>
			   <p><strong>Message:</strong> “Unite your team, boost your spirit! A mascot isn’t just a symbol; it brings energy, unity, and identity to your team.” &nbsp;</p>
			 </div></p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <li>Post relatable sports memes to encourage shares.</li>
  <li>&nbsp;Engage in local sports community groups to spread awareness.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why are these goals realistic?</p> 
<p><li>We are in the early stages, so small but consistent growth is key.</li>
</p>
<li>We prioritize quality engagement over a large but inactive audience</li></p>
           



	<div>
<p>2. Affect Objective – Emotional connection: How We Want the Audience to Feel</p>
		<p>We want our audience to feel:</p></div>
	  <ul>
		  <li>Curious – “What is TeamBeast? Why are mascots important?”</li>
		  <li>Excited &nbsp;– “This looks fun! Imagine if our team had a mascot!”</li>
		  <li>Interested – “How does this work? Can we get our own mascot?”</li>
<p>How do we create these emotions?</p>
<li>Simple, fun posts that introduce our brand and mascots</li>
<li>Polls &amp; questions (e.g., “What animal fits your team best?”). </li>
<li> Engaging visuals – showcasing fun team moments and mascots in action.</li>
 
	<div>
	
	<div>
	<p>3. Response Objective – What We Want the Audience to Do</p>
	  </div>
		
	<p>In the first four weeks of our campaign, our main goal is to generate meaningful social media engagement. As a new brand, we are not aiming for massive numbers, but rather quality interactions that show real interest in what TeamBeast offers. Each action from our audience is a signal that they connect with our message and are considering our mascots for their own teams.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Platform-specific goals</p>

    <p>Instagram – Engagement That Builds Community&nbsp;</p>
    <p>What we want to achieve:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1-2 shares per week where users tag teammates in posts or stories.</li>
      <li>1-2 comments or DMs from teams asking questions or showing interest in getting a mascot. &nbsp;</li>
	<li>Gain 10-15 new followers through regular content and story interactions.</li>
	<li>At least 10–20 likes per post to show consistent engagement. </li>
	
    </ul>
<p>Why it matters:</p>
		Instagram is our most visual and community-driven platform. When users tag teammates, it means they see value in the post and want others on their team to see it too. Direct messages or comments show intent and curiosity — strong signs of potential leads. Consistent likes and follower growth prove that our content is connecting with the right audience. 
	    <p>Tiktok  – Fun That Sparks Curiosity </p>
      <p>What we want to achieve:&nbsp;</p>
	  <li>1-2 shares per week through duet/stitch/tagging formats. </li>
	<li>1-2 comments or DMs reacting to mascot content or asking how to get one. </li>
	<li>Gain 5-10 new followers through viral trends and engagement. </li>
	<li>10-20 likes per video on mascot reveals, behind-the-scenes, or trend content. </li>
<p>Why it matters: </p>
<p>TikTok is all about quick impact and curiosity. If people share or stitch our videos, it means they find the content engaging or entertaining enough to pass on. Comments or DMs are a direct indicator that they’re considering us. And even a small number of followers can lead to high reach if engagement is high. </p>
  
<p>Facebook – Building Trust and Word-of-Mouth</p>
<p> What we want to achieve: </p>
<ul>
  <li>1 share per week in local sports groups or by parents/supporters.</li>
  <li>1-2 comments or messages from coaches, fans, or team pages.</li>
<li>Gain 5-10 followers on our Facebook page. </li>
<li>10+ likes per post, especially on longer posts and team stories. </li>
</ul>
<p>Why it matters: </p>
<p>Facebook users are often part of community networks. A single share in a group can lead to multiple conversations. Comments or DMs from this platform show we’re reaching coaches and managers — the people making team decisions. And likes on longer posts prove that people are not just scrolling, but taking the time to read and engage. </p>
<p>Overall Engagement Goals </p>
<p>By combining the strengths of each platform, in four weeks we aim to achieve: </p>
<li>1–2 shares per week across platforms → This shows people are passing on our content to teammates and friends. </li>
<li>1–2 direct messages/comments per week from interested teams → A key sign that people want to know more. </li>
<li>20+ new followers across all platforms → A small but strong audience that can grow into loyal fans. </li>
<li>10–20 likes per post/video → Consistent engagement that shows real interest in our brand. </li>
<p>We focus on quality over quantity, with realistic goals that match our current growth phase. Every tag, comment, like, or message helps build TeamBeast’s identity and momentum in the amateur sports world. </p>
		
<p><strong>Which social media do we use:</strong></p>
<p>We chose to use Instagram, Facebook and TikTok, according to our survey these are the most popular platforms for our primary target audience. Instagram and TikTok help us reach young players and team captains who love engaging content. Facebook allows us to connect with coaches, team managers, and local sports communities. This mix of platforms ensures we’re not just getting views but also building real connections with teams that need our mascots Since we are just starting, we need a mix of platforms that are great for visuals, engagement, and community-building. &nbsp;</p>

    </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Problems:&nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong> Lack of motivation:</strong> A weak team identity can cause amateur players to feel less engaged and enthusiastic about their team. This absence of pride and sense of belonging may result in poor attendance and a lack of interest during matches.&nbsp;</li>
            <li><strong> Lack of fan engagement:</strong> Supporters are less inclined to engage with or feel a bond to teams that do not have distinct branding. In the absence of mascots or a strong visual identity, there’s little to inspire loyalty, leading to low attendance and minimal online engagement.</li>
            <li><strong> Lack of identity:</strong> Numerous amateur teams lack logos, mascots, or cohesive branding, which renders them unremarkable and indistinct. This absence of identity impacts players' pride in representing their team and shapes fans' perceptions of them.&nbsp;</li>
            <li><strong> Changes in teams:</strong> Amateur teams frequently face significant player turnover, leading to disruptions in team cohesion. Establishing a robust and enduring brand can help preserve the team's identity amidst these transitions.&nbsp;</li>
            <li><strong> High costs for detailed branding:</strong> Many amateur teams with tight budgets find professional branding to be prohibitively costly. This financial hurdle hinders their ability to create a distinctive and polished team identity.&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>

The presence of a mascot or logo provides teams with a symbol to unite around, enhancing motivation and fostering a sense of community.&nbsp;</li>
